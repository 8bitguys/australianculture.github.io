        <h2>
          The Pre-British Era
        </h2>
        <p>
        Before the British came to Australia, it was the Aboriginees who had settled here.
	It is believed that they had arrived in Australia 40,000-70,000 years ago. 
	They started to build up their civilization. They developed a kind of 'hunter-gatherer' lifestyle. 
	They used 'Stone Technology' or tools made out of stone to evolve and survive. 
	They had lots of belief systems like worshipping and sacrifices. They built up tribes and developed their own language system.
	After that, a Dutchman called Willem Janszoon, who captained the Duyfken, came to Australia on a mission to map new areas of the world.
	He docked somewhere on the Australian Coast(the west coast of Cape York Peninsular in Queensland) and observed the aboriginees.
	After they left, the British came.
	When the British arrived, it was estimated that there was a population of around 350,000 to a whopping 750,000 aboriginees.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Attack of The British
        </h2>
        <p>
        On the 13th of May, 1787, the First Fleet arrived at Australia.
	Many say that they searching for land to build a prison but they actually weren't.
	The scientist, Joseph Banks, who had accompanied James Cook on the journey said that they should dock at Botany Bay so they did.
	The aboriginals avoided the British as much as they could at first but as they settled inland, there was no way of avoiding contact.
	There was a series of wars between the two sides that lasted for 146 years. They were called 'The Australian Frontier Wars'.
        
        <p>
        The main factors of fatalities on both sides were attacks and disease. 
	It is believed that the British brought some new diseases with them and they killed the aboriginals.
	They spread across the land and since the aborigines were too focused on beating the British, they didn't care about illnesses as much as they used too.
	There were a total of a total of at least 20,000 aborigines but recent studies show that they could be well over 100,000.
	However, the British-Europeans had only around 10,000. 
	However, the population dropped to a whopping 93,200(Approximately) in 1900 because of genocide and disease.
	However, this has changed as of research in 2011. 
	There was a huge increase and it went back to 670,000(Approx).
	It is estimated that it will increase up to 721,000 if the annual growth rate(2.2%)

        <h2>
          Immigration
        </h2>
        <p>
        The history of Australia's immigration is considered a big part in the history of human immigration.
	It began with the Aboriginal Australians who came about 50,000 years ago.
	Then permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the start of a new British penal colony(a remote prison).
	However, the convicts were blacksmiths and engineers.
	The British planned to build a proper settlement and the convicts would help them.
	However, the White Australia policy(a policy that banned Asians and the people from the Pacific Island) stopped immigration.
	After World War II, it was abolished and immigration was allowed again.
	Many foreigners started to come because of The Gold Rush, The Great Depression and the World Wars. Some of them include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Irish
          </li>
          <li>British
          </li>
          <li>Chinese
          </li>
          <li>Indians 
          </li>
	  <li>Jews
		</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Then the others started to flow in because of war and money.
	Australia is considered to be a very multi-racial country alongside the U.S and Canada. 
	It owes that to immigration.
