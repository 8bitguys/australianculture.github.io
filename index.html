				<h2>The Pre-British Era</h2>
				<p>Before the British came to Australia, it was the Aboriginees who had settled here. It is believed that they had arrived in Australia 40,000-70,000 years ago. They started to build up their civilization. They developed a kind of 'hunter-gatherer' lifestyle. They used 'Stone Technology' or tools made out of stone to evolve and survive. When the British arrived, it was estimated that there was a population of around 350,000 to a whopping 750,000 people. They had lots of belief systems like worshipping and sacrifices.</p>
